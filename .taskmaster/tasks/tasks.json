The solution features a dynamic 70% threshold pre-fetching algorithm that replaces the static 3-post threshold, triggering content loads when users reach 70% of current posts with a minimum threshold of 3 posts for small datasets. Performance improvements include Combine cancellation handling with Set<AnyCancellable>(), proper task cancellation to prevent race conditions, and enhanced error recovery. The robust state management prevents multiple concurrent requests, includes proper cleanup in the clearPosts() method, and features enhanced logging. Architecture improvements maintain the LazyVStack + ScrollView structure for optimal performance while preserving optimistic updates for user interactions and personalized feed logic. The implementation uses dynamic threshold calculation, cancels previous loading tasks before starting new ones, maintains separate loading states, and includes comprehensive logging for monitoring.\n</info added on 2025-08-09T21:30:48.335Z>",
