# ExploreView UI & Functionality Fixes

## üìã Overview
This update addresses several UI and functionality issues in the ExploreView including post toast positioning, toolbar cleanup, and list view display problems.

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. üÜô Post Toast/Card Positioning
**Issue:** Post preview toast was positioned too low, interfering with other UI elements.

**Solution:**
- **Moved post toast up** by changing `padding(.bottom, 20)` to `padding(.bottom, 80)`
- **Improved visual spacing** to ensure toast doesn't conflict with other UI elements
- **Maintains smooth animations** while providing better user experience

**Files Modified:**
- `Sources/PalyttApp/Features/Explore/ExploreView.swift` (lines ~790-815)

### 2. üóëÔ∏è Removed "Show Tabs" Toggle
**Issue:** The "Show Tabs" toggle button in the toolbar was cluttering the navigation bar.

**Solution:**
- **Removed tab visibility controls** from both primary and secondary toolbar positions
- **Simplified toolbar** to only show search and filter buttons
- **Cleaner UI** with fewer distracting elements in the navigation bar

**Technical Changes:**
```swift
// REMOVED: Tab visibility toggle from toolbar
// Button(action: { appState.toggleTabBar() }) { ... }
```

### 3. üìã Fixed List View Display Issues
**Issue:** The List tab in ExploreView wasn't displaying any content due to missing mock data reference.

**Root Cause:** Code was trying to access `MockData.mockShops` but the actual property is `MockData.sampleShops`.

**Solution:**
- **Fixed mock data reference** by changing `MockData.mockShops` to `MockData.sampleShops`
- **Ensured list view displays sample shops** when in list mode
- **Verified data consistency** across the app

**Technical Fix:**
```swift
// BEFORE: let shops: [Shop] = MockData.mockShops
// AFTER:  let shops: [Shop] = MockData.sampleShops
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Map Pin Color Update
- **Changed all post pins** to use primary brand green color (`.primaryBrand`)
- **Unified visual identity** by removing blue/orange distinction
- **Consistent branding** across map interface
