### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

#### Minor Issues Found
1. **TODO Comments**: 24 TODO items found (mostly feature enhancements, not critical)
   - Location: `SavedView.swift`, `ProfileView.swift`, `CommentsView.swift`
   - Impact: Low - these are future feature placeholders
   - Recommendation: Address before v2.0 release

2. **Debug Code**: Some debug print statements in production code
   - Location: `BackendService.swift`, `APIConfiguration.swift`
   - Impact: Low - doesn't affect functionality
   - Recommendation: Remove debug prints for App Store release

3. **Mock Data Dependencies**: Some views still reference mock data
   - Location: `EnhancedPostPickerView.swift` (saved places)
   - Impact: Low - fallback behavior works correctly
   - Recommendation: Implement full backend integration

#### Recommendations
```swift
// Remove debug prints like these before App Store submission:
#if DEBUG
print("🚨 WARNING: DEBUG build but not using LOCAL environment!")
#endif
```

   - Impact: Low - core functionality works without these
   - Recommendation: Implement in future iterations

2. **Mock Data**: Places API using mock data
   - Location: `places.ts`
   - Impact: Medium - affects location-based features
   - Recommendation: Integrate real Places API before production

3. **Missing Health Check**: No health check script in package.json
   - Impact: Low - affects monitoring capabilities
   - Recommendation: Add health check endpoint
