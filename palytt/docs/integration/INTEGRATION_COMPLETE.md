```

### **Data Flow Examples**

#### Post Creation Flow
```
1. User creates post in SwiftUI app
2. Images uploaded to BunnyCDN
3. Post data sent via tRPC to backend
4. Backend validates and stores in Convex
5. Real-time update sent to all clients
```

#### Comment System Flow  
```
1. User adds comment via iOS app
2. tRPC processes comment data
3. Convex stores comment with relationships
4. Live update pushes to all viewers
5. UI updates automatically via SwiftUI
```
